define a main function

	call draw() function

Init function
	change the viewport size

draw function
	load identity
	call drawWirePoly() function sending in number of points (9) and radius of 1

	call drawWireStar() function senind in radius of 1 and .5

	swap buffer so the things drawn will swap to the front buffer



drawWirePoly function
	start the line loop
	change color to green
	for loop till all points drawn
		math to calculate points based on number of sides
		plot the point 
	end loop
	end line loop	



drawWireStar function
	start the line loop
	change color to white
	for loop till all points drawn
		math to calculate points based on whether it is an outside or inside vertex of the star
		plot the point(s)
	end loop
	end line loop
