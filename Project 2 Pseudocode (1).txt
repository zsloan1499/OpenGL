Project 2 Pseudocode

import statements
import math

store mouse click vertices list


init function
	set up scene
	set matrix mode
	load the identity
	orthographic view

display function
	set color to black
	change point size to see vertices easier
	begin
	for vertices in vertex list added by mouse,
		draw vertex
	end
	if vertex list has points
		change color black
		begin
		get last vertex point and newest vertex point x and y, specify first end point
		get newest endpoint to draw the line between
	end
	flush it down

distance function take point 1 and the newest point being clicked
    calculate the distance between the two points in 2d space by using the pythagorean theorem
	#math.sqrt((point2[0] - point1[0])**2 + (point2[1] - point1[1])**2) ( added after calculated/ tested)

mouse function
	if mouse button == pressed down
		if click is near starting vertex (call distance fucntion)
			draw the first vertex again
		else
			add new vertex to the list using mouse x and y
		redraw the screen to show new changes/ redisplay

main function
	init
	dispay mode single with rgb
	window size and name
	call init function
	call mouse function with mouse func
	call glut main loop

call main function so it all works(easy to forget sometimes)
